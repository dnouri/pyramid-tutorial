Installation instructions
=========================

You may download the latest version of this tutorial here:

  https://github.com/dnouri/pyramid-tutorial/zipball/master

Alternatively, clone with git::

  $ git clone git@github.com:dnouri/pyramid-tutorial.git


C compiler
==========

If you're on Debian or Ubuntu, you can install a C compiler with::

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential

If you're using Mac OSX, you need to install Xcode:
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/


Python 2.6 or 2.7 and header files
==================================

On Debian or Ubuntu::

  $ sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev

Alternatively, compile from source::

  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ cd ~
  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ mkdir tmp
  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ mkdir opt
  [chrism@vitaminf ~]$ cd tmp
  [chrism@vitaminf tmp]$ wget \
         http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.4/Python-2.6.4.tgz
  [chrism@vitaminf tmp]$ tar xvzf Python-2.6.4.tgz
  [chrism@vitaminf tmp]$ cd Python-2.6.4
  [chrism@vitaminf Python-2.6.4]$ ./configure \
          --prefix=$HOME/opt/Python-2.6.4
  [chrism@vitaminf Python-2.6.4]$ make; make install

Once these steps are performed, the Python interpreter will be
invokable via ``$HOME/opt/Python-2.6.4/bin/python`` from a shell
prompt.


Install virtualenv
==================

Try to see if you have virtualenv installed::

  $ virtualenv . --no-site-packages

If it says "command not found", you'll have to install virtualenv
first, and re-run the command above after you completed installation.
The virtualenv installation instructions vary between operating
systems.


Install virtualenv on Debian or Ubuntu
--------------------------------------

If you don't have virtualenv, and you're on Debian or Ubuntu, do::

  $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv


Install virtualenv on other systems
-----------------------------------

Download this file and run it with your Python interpreter to create
the virtualenv::

  $ curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/virtualenv/master/virtualenv.py
  $ python virtualenv.py .

If this doesn't work, try::

  $ sudo easy_install virtualenv  # run this command as root

and then create the virtualenv as normally.


virtualenv's bin/python
=======================

After installing the virtualenv package, and creating your virtualenv
directory, you should have a Python executable inside the ``bin/``
directory.  Try to run it::

  $ bin/python
  Python 2.7.2+ (default, Oct  4 2011, 20:06:09) 
  [GCC 4.6.1] on linux2
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> 


Install Pyramid
===============

There's also ``bin/pip``, which you'll use to install Pyramid into
your new virtualenv::

  $ bin/pip install pyramid==1.4.5
  Downloading/unpacking pyramid==1.4.5
    Downloading pyramid-1.4.5.tar.gz (2.4Mb): 2.4Mb downloaded
  ...
  Successfully installed pyramid Chameleon Mako WebOb repoze.lru zope.interface zope.deprecation venusian translationstring PasteDeploy MarkupSafe
  Cleaning up...

Great, you now have Pyramid installed!


Run our first Pyramid web app
=============================

Our first example application consists of a single Python file ::

  $ bin/python ex1_hello/hello.py
  Server started at http://localhost:8080

Now you can open http://localhost:8080/hello/world in your browser,
and you should see "Hello world!".

Press Ctrl-C to stop the application.

If everything worked so far, continue with reading the contents of
``ex1_hello/hello.py``.


Should the instructions not work
================================

These instructions apply to Linux and Mac OSX systems.  If you're on
Windows, you may want to refer to the Pyramid installation
instructions online:
http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/narr/install.html

If installation doesn't work, and you're sitting in the live tutorial,
find a colleague who has a working installation and follow along with
them.

If you're not in a hurry, but still can't get installation to work,
consider installing a recent Ubuntu in a virtual machine.
Installation on Debian or Ubuntu is considerably easier than on other
systems.
